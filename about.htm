						<h4> About Ali</h4>
						<p>
						My name is Ali Houmani, I'm 22 years old and I'm a recent college graduate.
						I have a lot of experience using many different programming languages due to my time at Algonquin College which I believe would benefit any organization that decides to make me part of their team!
						My background is Lebanese, both my parents were born in Lebanon but had to leave due to the country's trouble at the time. I haven't been to Lebanon but one day I hope to go visit.
						If you would like to know more check out the sections!
						</p>

						<h4> My Hobbies </h4>
						One of my main hobbies are working out. I have been working out since I was 16, I love staying active and being fit!
						Another one of my hobbies is software development! I'm currently building my own Iphone app, it's almost done so if you want to check it out visit www.escapewithstick.com !

						<h4>Education</h4>
						I am a graduate of Algonquin College. While I was there I obtained a diploma in Computer Programming. Going to Algonquin was one of the best decisions I have made because it taught me how to learn on my own as well as to stay focused.
						I briefly went to Carleton University. I was taking Political Science with a Minor in Psychology. I didn't enjoy the program so I decided to go to Algonquin College.
						Before I was able to make my journey to Algonquin, I attended St.Nicks Adult High School because I was missing a Math course.	I graduated from Hillcrest High School, I was part of the Honor society.
						
						<h4> My Family</h4>
						I have quite a big family. I have 6 younger siblings!
						I love them all and I would do anything for them.
						Not only do I have siblings but I also have two cats named Kovu and Thor.
						I decided that I wanted a cat so I decided to get Kovu. About a year later my cousin found Thor at a junk yard and we decided to give him a home.
